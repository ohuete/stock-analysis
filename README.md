# Stock Analysis: Refactored Code
## Overview of the project
### Purpose
To help Steve analyze and find the best stocks for his parents to invest in, I developed a VBA code via Excel that would analyze the data efficiently. Since Steve was so content with the initial VBA code he asked me to improve it so he could analyze the entire stock market over the last few years. While the initial code may have worked, there was room for improvement so that it would run faster and more efficiently. In this project, I refactored the code to make it run faster. I have provided images of my improved code and timestamps of execution times to compare the original code with the refactored verison.
