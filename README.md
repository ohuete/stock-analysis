# Stock Analysis: Refactored Code
## Overview of the project
### Purpose
To help Steve analyze and find the best stocks for his parents to invest in, I developed a VBA code via Excel that would analyze the data efficiently. Since Steve was so content with the initial VBA code he asked me to improve it so he could analyze the entire stock market over the last few years. While the initial code may have worked, there was room for improvement so that it would run faster and more efficiently. In this project, I refactored the code to make it run faster. I have provided images of my improved code and timestamps of execution times to compare the original code with the refactored verison. 
## Results
### Analysis 
The goal for this project was to create a new code for Steve so that he could analyze all stocks throughout multiple years. Since I had already developed a code for him, all I had to do was slightly modify it so that not only could it do what Steve wanted it to, but in a much more efficient manner. Some modifications in my refatored code can be seen in For Loop funncitons of the tickerVolumes and the tickerIndex. Also, in this refactored code, I left the For Loop in "i" and removed the "j" variable. One key component in the refactor is that I also reassigned the buttons on the worksheet to operate under the refactored code and not the previous code. If not, it would keep giving me the data under the original code. All of this led to the code running faster and efficiently. I have attached screenshots of time stamps from the original code and the refactored for comparison. The images indicate that
